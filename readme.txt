This addon contains 5 different fonts (and default WoW font) for damage. The file named "font.ttf" will replace your default WoW damage font.
To swap between the fonts just rename the font you want to have to "font.ttf", replacing the old one. 
All fonts have a backup in special folder.
Yoou can add your favorite font just copy to: ...\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\CoolDamageFont  and rename it to font.ttf

Enjoy it >.<
