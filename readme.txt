Description
This addon is an update to the outdated CoolDamageFont. The previous addon used the PEPSI font as its default font. This font is missing key symbols needed for the Shadowlands expansion. This addon replaces the default font with Roboto Black Italic, as well as updates some base code. It should be noted that the old PEPSI font is still included in the CoolDamageFont2 addon folder but be warned you will get strange symbols in your damage text if used during Shadowlands and later.

Changes:
- Updates default font with one that works in the Shadowlands expansion.
